# calculator
This is an online calculator! :exclamation:

It's an online calculator written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. You'll be able to do sums, subtraction, multiples and divisions. Right now it only do basic calculations, without the support of doing counts with float numbers but soon I'll be working on that.

It was a great oportunite for me to develop my Vanilla Javascript abilities and my logical thinking. :technologist:
